#### 
 - **Goal**: Reduce waste
 - **Target**: Reduce waste by x%
 - **Best Practice**: [Decommission resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/decommission-resources.html)
  - **Measures**: amount of waste removed
 - **Good/Bad**: Bad
 - **Why? When does it work well or not?**: Does not work long term as it requires waste to always exist, but it could be possibly used as a short term goal. Instead, set a positive goal of minimizing waste creation - such as having waste not exceed a set $ amount.
