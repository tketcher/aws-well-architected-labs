## Evaluate new services

#### Develop a workload review process
 - **Goal**: Perform Well-Architected reviews throughout a workloads lifecycle
 - **Target**: For Tier1 workloads each stage has a full review, for Tier2 and below workloads the minimum requirement is: In the development stage review Security, Reliability and Operational Excellence. In Performance test review Performance Efficiency and Cost Optimization.
 - **Best Practice**: [Optimize Over Time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/optimize-over-time.html)
  - **Measures**: % of workloads reviewed in each stage
 - **Good/Bad**: Good
 - **Why? When does it work well or not?**: Ensures the correct level review is performed inline with organization requirements. It also allows for tradeoffs if the organization is prioritizing speed to market for some workloads.

#### Review and analyze this workload regularly
 - **Goal**: Perform Well-Architected reviews regularly on active workloads
 - **Target**: Tier1 workloads will have milestones with all pillars completed at least every 3 months, for Tier2 workloads milestones with all pillars are completed at least every 6 months, all other workloads are to have milestones with all pillars completed yearly.
 - **Best Practice**: [Optimize Over Time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/optimize-over-time.html)
  - **Measures**: Number of milestones completed, number of teams delivering
 - **Good/Bad**: Good
 - **Why? When does it work well or not?**: Ensures workloads are actively maintained and inline with best practices. Will result in higher operational costs if there are minimal changes in the workload, and no additional services/features available.
