## Data Transfer

### Data transfer modelling
#### 
 - **Goal**: Reduce unnecessary data transfer
 - **Target**: Data transfer pattern between 1st & 2nd tier, must be within 10% of the pattern between the internet and 1st tier
 - **Best Practice**: [Data transfer modelling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/plan-for-data-transfer.html)
  - **Measures**: Number of reports delivered, number of teams delivering
 - **Good/Bad**: Bad
 - **Why? When does it work well or not?**: Hard to convert to $, but it could help to indicate there is an issue - but again hard to quantify the cost of the issue
 - **Contact/Contributor**: natbesh@amazon.com
